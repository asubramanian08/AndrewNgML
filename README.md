## MachineLearning
Coursera Machine Learning by Stanford University

### About
I took Coursera's [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course by Stanford University around the beginning of the 2021 school year. Andrew Ng teaches supervised and unsupervised machine learning as well as some of the best practices in machine learning. This course has taught me so much about machine learning and code creation; I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to start learning machine learning.

### Organization
Each topic has its own folder:
* The folder is named (week#).(topic#)-(Description)
* Notes for each sub-section named (section#)-(Description).txt
* Lecture PDF _private_
* Quiz with question, answers, and score _private_
* Octave exercise in a zip file _possibly there_
* Programming code (in Octave 3.8.0) expanded octave zip file with exercises complete _possibly there_

For programming exercises and submissions: There are two programming languages that can be used: Octave or MATLAB. For both some files are given for submissions and exercises described in [EnvironmentInstructions.txt](https://github.com/asubramanian08/MachineLearning/blob/master/EnvironmentInstructions.txt). There are also set up instructions for both Octave and MATLAB in [2.1-MultiVarLinearRegression/1-EnvironmentSetup.txt](https://github.com/asubramanian08/MachineLearning/blob/master/2.1-MultiVarLinearRegression/1-EnvironmentSetup.txt).
