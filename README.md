### About
I took Coursera's [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course by Standford University around the beginning of the 2021 school year. Andrew Ng teaches supervised and unsupervised learning as well as some of the best practices in machine learning. This course is simmilar to standford's [CS229](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html).
