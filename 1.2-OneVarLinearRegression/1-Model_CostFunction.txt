Model Representation: ×2
    The first learning algorithm is liner regression - see the model and process
    We are using the example of housing prices - dataset from portland, OR
    This is again a supervised learning (given right answers), regression problem
    Can draw a line to the dataset and determine what the price of someone's house should be
    Training set: the dataset given to train the machine
    Notation:
        m - # of training examples
        x - the input variable
        y - target variable
        (x,y) - one training example (a row in the training set table)
        (x^(i),y^(i)) - the ith training example (i ≠ exponent)
        h - hypothesis function given from the learning algorithm to map from x to y
    Question: What is y^(3) in the below training set
    Size in feet^2 (x) | Price ($) in 1000's (y)

    Answer: C
    How the algorithm works:
        feed training set to learning algorithm
        learning algorithm gives h (look at notation)
    Univariate linear regression: How represent h - h_θ(x) = θ_0 + θ_1x (shorthand: h(x))
    NOTE:
        notation - X and Y is the space of all input and output variables respectively
        formal statement of supervised learning (training set to learn h ... )
        regression vs. classification problems
Cost Function: ×2
    We will define the cost function to fit the best line to the data
    Parameters: All θ_i's in the definition of h
    How to choose the parameters (2 for Univariate linear regression)
    Graph the function θ_0 + θ_1x by substituting the θ_i values for the learning algorithm output
    Question: What are the θ_0 and θ_1 values of the below graph of h_θ(x)

        θ_0 = 0, θ_1 = 1
        θ_0 = 0.5, θ_1 = 1
        θ_0 = 1, θ_1 = 0.5
        θ_0 = 1, θ_1 = 1
    Answer: B
    Need Parameters so h(x) is close to y for the training examples (x,y)
    Goal is to minimize ∑_(i=1)^m (h_θ(x^(i)) - y^(i))^2; To make math easier do 1/(2m) * (to minimize)
    Cost function: J(θ_0,θ_1) = 1/2m * ∑_(i=1)^m (h_θ(x^(i)) - y^(i))^2; minimize J(θ_0,θ_1)
    Squared error cost function: J(θ_0,θ_1) is the most reasonable choice for regression problems
    Over the next few videos get better intuition to the cost function ~ J(θ_0,θ_1)
    NOTE: Cost function definition and understanding, the 1/2 of mean is a convenience that cancels out
Cost Function - Intuition I: ×2
    What is the cost function doing? - How should we use it?
    Simplify h(x) to θ_1x or set θ_0 to 0 ~ this function will pass though (0,0)
    Can plot the cost function for θ_1 to get better understanding
    Working with the data set: (1,1); (2,2); (3,3)
    J(θ_1) is the sum of the square distances between y^(i) and h_θ(x^(i))
    J(1) = 0, J(0.5) ≈ 0.58, J(0) ≈ 2.3, J(-0.5) ≈ 5.15 ~ Parabola?
    Question: What is J(0) with the above scenario
        0

        1
        14/6
    Answer: D
    The optimization is find the min J(θ_1) - bottom of curve which finds what best fits data
    Next we will look at J(θ_0,θ_1) or both variables
    NOTE:
        Objective is to make the best straight line so J(...) is min
        Can plug in values for the functions, plotting can help visualize
Cost Function - Intuition II: ×2
    This uses contour plots and contour figures - if don't understand that is ok
    Before the plot was in a bowl shape - adding a another dimension (θ_0) creates a 3d bowl
    Instead of looking at the 3d models we will use contour plots
    On a contour plot of J(θ_0,θ_1) points on the same ellipse have the same J(θ_0,θ_1) values
    The closer it gets to the smaller ellipse (or best values) the better fit it is
    We want an efficient software to find the best answer
    We will see higher dimensional figures that would be harder to visualize
    NOTE: Contour plot with examples
