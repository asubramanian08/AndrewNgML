Welcome:
    We will learn state of the art machine learning and implement these algorithms
    Using machine learning without knowing is: Search engines rank pages, ...
    The AI dream of making truly learning robots by learning how the brain works
    Just knowing the algorithms and math isn't good enough - learn how to implement it
    We didn't know how to make programs do more interesting things - so machine learning stuck around
    Examples of machine learning:
        Database mining: datasets from automation and the web
        What humans can't do: flying helicopter, handwriting recognition, NLP, computer vision
        Self-customizing programs: recommendations - like amazon and netflix
        Understand humans and brains
    There is a lot of demand to learn machine learning
What is machine learning: x2
    No universal definition of machine learning: below are Arthur Samuel's and Tom Mitchell's definitions
    Machine learning is the study of computers learning without being explicitly programmed
    A computer learns from experience E if by performance measure P it improves on Task T
    Question: Email spam learns by you marking something as spam. What is the task its trying to improve
        Classifying emails as spam or not spam
        Watching you label emails as spam or not spam
        The number (or fraction) of email correctly identified as spam/not spam
        None of the above - not a machine learning problem
    Answer: A; B is E and C is P
    Machine learning algorithms: Broad algorithm catagories
        Supervised learning - tell the machine what to learn
        unsupervised Leaning - the machine decides how to learn on its own
        There are some others - reinforcement learning, recommender systems
    Much bigger focus on knowing what algorithms to use when - best practices
    NOTES: 2 machine learning definitions, catagories of learning algorithms

Supervised Learning: x2
    Supervise learning is one of the most common type of machine learning problem
    Example: given housing prices and their square feet, determine what the price of a house should be
        Choose - straight line or quadratic function from the data
    Regression problem: continues valued number (the above is an example)
    Supervised learning: given the right answers and then has to predict another right answer 
    Example: Plots of tumor size if its malignant, find probability that a tumor it is malignant
    Classification problem: Discrete valued output (the above is an example)
        Can plot by having symbol for values -> then multiple qualifying attributes
        The learning algorithm might divide the sections then determine most likely outcome
    The goal is to use an infinite number of attributes to determine result
    Support vector machine has a mathematical trick to deal with infinite number of features
    Question: Predict how many identical items with be sold over 3 months:
        It is a regression problem
        It is a classification problem
    Answer: A
    Question: Decide if an account has been hacked
        It is a regression problem
        It is a classification problem
    Answer: B
    NOTE: supervised learning description, 2 supervised learning catagories, examples of catagories
Unsupervised Learning: x2
    Clustering: given a bunch of data points determine that clusters that are there
    Example: Google news puts together many news articles that have similar topics
        Given how expressed a gene is cluster people into groups
    In unsupervised learning we are not giving the right answer - just make sense of the data
    Some applications: organize computer clusters, social network, market segmentation, astronomical data
    Cocktail party problem: multiple people talking, how will 2 differently placed microphones hear
        The machine learning program will separate out the different voices
        With just one line of code in the right environment this problem can be solved
    We will use octave which is free open source software or mathLab
    In silicon valley they prototype their code in octave because it is quick to implement
    Question: which are unsupervised learning algorithms
        spam filter
        group news articles about the same story
        discover market segments
        learn if someone has diabetes
    Answer: B, C
    NOTE:
        derive structure from data with unsupervised learning
        There is no feedback based on predictions
        2 unsupervised types: clustering, non-clustering (cocktail party)
Who are Mentors:
    Mentors are students pick by coursera who have already done that course
    The are meant to set an example and report abuse ... but are not approved by Stanford University
Get to Know your Classmates:
    Interacting with your classmates will make the learning experience more enjoyable
    On the meet and greet introduce yourself and look at two interesting profiles
    Can update the coursera profile so people will better know who you are
