Welcome to Machine Learning:
    Its all around us: Google search, facial recognition, Spam emails
    Machine Learning: Computer's learning without being explicitly programmed
    Building AI or making truly intelligent machines might be by building neural networks like our brain
Machine Learning Honor Code:
    The code that we submit must be our own - no looking at other student's source code
    Don't post code or quick fixes in discussion forum - ask conceptional questions
