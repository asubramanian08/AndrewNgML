Setting up your Programming Assignment Environment:
    This course has many programming assignments that need to be submitted with Octave or MATLAB
    Octave: Free open source platform, text interface and experimental graphical one
    MATLAB: Proprietary software, free trial licence for completion of this course
    Both software are free for this course then MATLAB has to be paid for
    Quality Difference: MATLAB may run smoother for Mac and be more robust but both have been used
    Installation: Found in next material
Access to MATLAB Online and the Exercise Files for MATLAB Users:
    A MATLAB online licence has been provided - web interface of MATLAB desktop program
    To get MATLAB online:
        Create an account: https://www.mathworks.com/mwaccount/register
        Apply licence: https://www.mathworks.com/licensecenter/classroom/machine_learning/
        Click Access MATLAB Online and log it
        Upload the exercise files
    ex1-ex8-matlab.zip are the exercise files for MATLAB online or MATLAB R2018b or later
    MATLAB online users should: (MATLAB desktop users can stop the exercise where they choose)
        Click 'Upload' in the 'Home' tab of MATLAB online
        Select the ex1-ex8-matlab.zip file and open it
        Enter "unzip ex1-ex8-matlab.zip" at the command line
    To do the programming assignments:
        Don't download the exercise files for the first programming exercise
        Record assignment token on the exercise page to submit solution
        The READ ME file will go though how to complete the exercises
        Look at the READ ME file for help with common issues
Installing Octave on Windows:
    Install link: http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_Microsoft_Windows
    Patch: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions/vgCyrQoMEeWv5yIAC00Eog?
    Don't install Octave 4.0.0 - look at "Resources" menu of "Installation Issues"
Installing Octave on Mac OS X (10.10 Yosemite and 10.9 Mavericks and Later):
    The Mac OS X Gatekeeper might prevent installation: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491
    Go to Security & Privacy and allow app downloads from anywhere
    Download 3.8.0 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/octave/files/Octave%20MacOSX%20Binary/2013-12-30%20
    binary%20installer%20of%20Octave%203.8.0%20for%20OSX%2010.9.1%20%28beta%29/GNU_Octave_3.8.0-6.dmg/
    download) or the latest version that isn't 4.0.0
    Open the dmg then the mpkg inside
    Follow the installation instructions
    The app is Octave-cli - the text interface for octave
    There is an experimental Octave-gui but Octave-cli is more stable
    If you use Homebrew or MacPorts ...: http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_macOS#Package_Managers
    Don't install Octave 4.0.0 - look at "Resources" menu of "Installation Issues"
Installing Octave on Mac OS X (10.8 Mountain Lion and Earlier):
    Octave doesn't support this: use Homebrew: http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_MacOS_X#Homebrew
    Don't install Octave 4.0.0 - look at "Resources" menu of "Installation Issues"
Installing Octave on GNU/Linux:
    Recommend using system package manager: http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_GNU/Linux
    On ubuntu: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install octave
    On Fedora: sudo yum install octave-forge
    For other GNU/Linux: http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_GNU/Linux
    Don't install Octave 4.0.0 - look at "Resources" menu of "Installation Issues"
